// To try to mitigate flaky tests due to blinking text carets and the like, as well what I can only think is a browser
// bug in the screenshotting of tooltips. Tooltip screenshots are currently prone to incorrectly having a very slight
// degree of transparency, no matter how much time is given for them to fade in. Experimentation appeared to reveal
// that this only tends to happen in screenshots that are clipped (not full page) and that when multiple screenshots
// are taken of the same element right after one another it can happen in any one of them (or multiple). This
// inconsistency seems to suggest a bug in the screenshotting and/or clipping code, which appears to be implemented
// within the browser or devtools, rather than puppeteer. All we can really do about it is increase the retryTimes.
