import { NxList, NxVulnerabilityIndicator, formatVulnerabilityScore } from '@sonatype/react-shared-components';

const NxVulnerabilityScoreListExample = () =>
  <NxList>
    <NxList.Item>
      <NxVulnerabilityIndicator severityLevel="none" />
      <NxList.Text className="nx-vulnerability-score">{formatVulnerabilityScore(0)}</NxList.Text>
      <NxList.Subtext>
        In this row, the vulnerability score value is the only content in
        the <code className="nx-code">.nx-list__text</code>, so there's no need to make a separate element;
        the <code className="nx-code">.nx-vulnerability-score</code> class can be applied directly to
        the <code className="nx-code">.nx-list__text</code>.
      </NxList.Subtext>
    </NxList.Item>
    <NxList.Item>
      <NxVulnerabilityIndicator severityLevel="low" />
      <NxList.Text>
        <span className="nx-vulnerability-score">{formatVulnerabilityScore(1)}</span> is the vulnerability (CVSS) score.
      </NxList.Text>
      <NxList.Subtext>
        In this row, there is other content aside from the vulnerability score value within
        the <code className="nx-code">.nx-list__text</code>, so a separate element is needed in order
        to ensure that the <code className="nx-code">.nx-vulnerability-score</code> styles are applied only to the
        vulnerability score value itself. Note that as of RSC 2.0.0, nx-vulnerability-score does not actually
        have any styles that are distinct from the rest of the main list text. That may change in the future however, so
        usage of <code className="nx-code">.nx-vulnerability-score</code> here is still desired.
      </NxList.Subtext>
    </NxList.Item>
  </NxList>;
