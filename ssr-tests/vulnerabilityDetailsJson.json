  "description": "Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 through 6.0.14, 5.5.0 through 5.5.25, and 4.1.0 through 4.1.36 does not properly handle (1) double quote (\") characters or (2) %5C (encoded backslash) sequences in a cookie value, which might cause sensitive information such as session IDs to be leaked to remote attackers and enable session hijacking attacks.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-3385.",
  "explanationMarkdown": "Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to Information Disclosure.  The ``appendCookieValue()`` method in the `ServerCookie` class does not properly validate cookies for double quote `\"` or encoded backslash `%5C` characters. This can allow an attacker to escape out of the cookie value and inject cookie attributes such as the `Expires` attribute, leading to session IDs or other sensitive information unintentionally being written to the user's file system.\n\nExample: \n>http://www.example.com/examples/servlets/servlet/CookieExample?cookiename=test&cookievalue=test%5c%5c%22%3B+Expires%3DThu%2C+1+Jan+2009+00%3A00%3A01+UTC%\n3B+Path%3D%2Fservlets-examples%2Fservlet+%3B\n\nReference Link:\n[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31130/](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31130/)\n\nNote: This vulnerability is due to an insufficient fix for CVE-2007-3385.",
